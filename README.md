### Knapsack Problem
The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in combinatorial optimization and computer science. It involves selecting a subset of items to maximize a certain value, subject to a weight or capacity constraint.
You are given a set of items, each with a specific weight and value, and a knapsack (bag) that can hold up to a certain total capacity or weight. The goal is to select a subset of these items to put into the knapsack so that the total value of the selected items is maximized and the total weight of the selected items does not exceed the knapsack's capacity.

#### Common Knapsack Examples
**0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Each item can either be taken or left behind; you cannot take fractions of items. Using DP, we can build a DP table where each cell represents the maximum value that can be achieved with a given number of items and a given capacity.

- Step 1: Let dp[i][w] be the maximum value that can be achieved with the first i items and a knapsack capacity w.
- Step 2: For each item i
  - If you don’t take the item, then dp[i][w] = dp[i-1][w] (the value remains the same as without this item).
  - If you take the item, then dp[i][w] = max(dp[i-1][w], dp[i-1][w-w_i] + v_i) (i.e., either take the item or not, and maximize the value).
- Step 3: If no items are chosen (i = 0) or the knapsack capacity is zero (w = 0), the value is 0, so dp[0][w] = 0 for all w.

The knapsack problem and its variants are widely used in fields like resource allocation, finance, logistics, and cryptography.

### Influential Figures
1. Richard Bellman

In the 1950s, he formalized the concept of DP and introduced the principle of optimality, which states that an optimal solution to a problem can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems. Bellman’s work revolutionized how complex optimization problems were solved, particularly in control theory and decision processes.

2. Stuart Dreyfus

A collaborator of Bellman, Stuart Dreyfus contributed to DP's applications to continuous systems and control processes. Dreyfus extended DP techniques into areas like aerospace engineering, notably applying them to solve problems involving optimal control and decision-making under uncertainty.

3. László Lovász

Lovász contributed to the development of efficient dynamic programming algorithms for graph theory problems. His work in the area of lattice reduction and graph optimization led to exploring the Knapsack problem and connections between combinatorics and optimization using dynamic programming techniques.

4. Howard Raiffa

Contribution: Raiffa worked on decision theory and was a key figure in applying dynamic programming to real-world decision-making processes. His work emphasized Bayesian decision theory and its relation to dynamic programming in terms of sequential decision-making under uncertainty.

5. John von Neumann

While von Neumann is better known for his contributions to game theory, computer science, and quantum mechanics, his early work on minimax theorems and decision-making laid important groundwork for the development of dynamic programming in the context of game theory and optimization. His collaboration with Oskar Morgenstern on Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944) influenced Bellman’s thinking on optimization and decision processes.

6. Eugene Lawler

Lawler made important contributions to the application of dynamic programming in combinatorial optimization problems, particularly in tasks such as scheduling and sequencing. His work on the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and job-shop scheduling brought DP techniques to a broader audience in operations research and computer science.
